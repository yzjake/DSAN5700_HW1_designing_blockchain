    "Each blockchain starts with a genesis block. We will need to define this block function in object-oriented python. Here are the main Block components we will need:\n",

    "Index - The index of the block on the chain (zero-indexed).\n",
    "Timestamp – Time (T) when the block was added to the chain.\n",
    "data - The data the block contains (Usually points to the root of a Merkel tree, but we can use a common thread for this).\n",
    "previous_hash - The hash value of the previous block.\n",
    "hash - Hash of this block computed using the hash_block function.\n",
    "nonce - The variable value that we change to alter the hash output (Default value = 0, irrelevant in this section).\n",
    "We will need to define two functions in class Object named Block, and the two functions are __init__() (called dunder init) and blockHash(). The init function takes six inputs, including a self, from the list above (#5 above is the output). The blockHash function takes inputs from init in a string form, appends them, and encodes them through a SHA256 function.\n",
